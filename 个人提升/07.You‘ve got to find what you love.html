                It started before I was born. My biological mother was a young, unwed graduate student, and she decided to put me up for adoption. She felt very strongly that I should be adopted by college graduates, so everything was all set for me to be adopted at birth by a lawyer and his wife. Except that when I popped out, they decided at the last minute that they really wanted a girl. So my parents, who were on a waiting list, got a call in the middle of the night asking, "We've got an unexpected baby boy. Do you want him?" They said, "Of course."

                And 17 years later I did go to college. But I naively chose a college that was almost as expensive as Stanford. And all of my working class parents' savings were being spent on my college tuition. After six months, I couldn't see the value in it. I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life, and no idea how college was going to help me figure it out. And here I was, spending all of the money my parents had saved their entire life. So I decided to drop out and trust that it would all work out OK. It was pretty scary at the time, but looking back it was one of the best decisions I ever made.

I didn't have a dorm room, so I slept on the floor in friends' rooms. I returned Coke bottles for the five-cent deposits to buy food with. And I would walk the seven miles across town every Sunday night to get one good meal a week at the Hare Krishna temple. I loved it.

                And much of what I stumbled into, by following my curiosity and intuition, turned out to be priceless later on. Let me give you one example. Reed College at that time offered perhaps the best calligraphy instruction in the country. Throughout the campus, every poster, every label on every drawer, was beautifully hand-calligraphed. Because I had dropped out, and didn't have to take the normal classes, I decided to take a calligraphy class to learn how to do this. I learned about serif and sans-serif typefaces, about varying the amount of space between different letter combinations, about what makes great typography great. It was beautiful, historical, artistically subtle, in a way that science can't capture. And I found it fascinating.

                而我跟随好奇心和直觉所偶然接触到的许多东西,后来被证明是无价之宝。让我给你们举个例子。当时的里德学院可能提供了全国最好的书法教学。整个校园里,每一张海报、每一个抽屉的标签都是精美的手写书法。因为我已经退学了,不必上那些正常的课程,所以我决定去上书法课来学习如何写书法。我学习了衬线和无衬线字体,学习了如何调整不同字母组合之间的间距,学习了是什么让伟大的字体设计如此出色。这是美丽的、历史性的、艺术上微妙的,是科学无法捕捉的。我觉得这太迷人了。

                None of this had even a hope of any practical application in my life. But ten years later, when we were designing the first Macintosh computer, it all came back to me. And we designed it all into the Mac. It was the first computer with beautiful typography. If I had never dropped in on that single course in college, the Mac would have never had multiple typefaces or proportionally spaced fonts. And since Windows just copied the Mac, it's likely that no personal computer would have them.

                这一切在当时看来,根本不可能在我的人生中有任何实际应用。但十年后,当我们设计第一台麦金塔电脑时,这一切都回到了我的脑海中。我们把这一切都设计进了Mac。它是第一台拥有精美字体的电脑。如果我当时没有旁听那门课程,Mac就不会有多种字体或按比例间距的字体。而由于Windows只是复制了Mac,很可能所有的个人电脑都不会有这些功能。

            <div class="english">
                My second story is about love and loss. I was lucky. I found what I loved to do early in life. Woz and I started Apple in my parents' garage when I was 20. We worked hard, and in ten years Apple had grown from just the two of us in a garage into a $2 billion company with over 4,000 employees. We just released our finest creation—the Macintosh—a year earlier, and I'd just turned 30. And then I got fired. How can you get fired from a company you started?

                Well, as Apple grew, we hired someone—who I thought was very talented—to run the company with me. And for the first year or so, things went well. But then our visions of the future began to diverge. And eventually we had a falling out. When we did, our board of directors sided with him. And so at 30 I was out, and very publicly out. What had been the focus of my entire adult life was gone, and it was devastating.

                嗯,随着苹果的发展,我们雇佣了一个我认为非常有才华的人来和我一起管理公司。大约第一年左右,一切都很顺利。但后来我们对未来的愿景开始产生分歧。最终我们闹翻了。当这发生时,董事会站在了他那边。于是在30岁时,我被赶了出来,而且是非常公开地被赶了出来。我整个成年生活的重心消失了,这是毁灭性的打击。

                I really didn't know what to do for a few months. I felt that I had let the previous generation of entrepreneurs down, that I had dropped the baton as it was being passed to me. I met with David Packard and Bob Noyce, and tried to apologize for screwing up so badly. I was a very public failure, and I even thought about running away from the Valley. But something slowly began to dawn on me: I still loved what I did. The turn of events at Apple had not changed that one bit. I'd been rejected, but I was still in love. And so I decided to start over.

The heaviness of being successful was replaced by the lightness of being a beginner again, less sure about everything. It freed me to enter one of the most creative periods of my life. During the next five years, I started a company named NeXT, another company named Pixar, and fell in love with an amazing woman who would become my wife. Pixar went on to create the world's first computer-animated feature film, <em>Toy Story</em>, and is now the most successful animation studio in the world.

                In a remarkable turn of events, Apple bought NeXT, and I returned to Apple. And the technology we developed at NeXT is at the heart of Apple's current renaissance. And Laurene and I have a wonderful family together. I'm pretty sure none of this would have happened if I hadn't been fired from Apple. It was awful-tasting medicine, but I guess the patient needed it. Sometimes life's gonna hit you in the head with a brick. Don't lose faith.

            <div class="english">
                My third story is about death. When I was 17, I read a quote that went something like, "If you live each day as if it was your last, someday you'll most certainly be right." It made an impression on me. And since then, for the past 33 years, I have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself, "If today were the last day of my life, would I wanna do what I am about to do today?" And whenever the answer has been no for too many days in a row, I know I need to change something.

                我的第三个故事是关于死亡。当我17岁时,我读到一句话,大意是:"如果你把每一天都当作生命的最后一天来过,那么总有一天你一定是对的。"这句话给我留下了深刻的印象。从那时起,在过去的33年里,我每天早上都会照镜子,问自己:"如果今天是我生命的最后一天,我还想做我今天要做的事情吗?"每当连续很多天答案都是"不"时,我知道我需要做出改变。

                Remembering that I'll be dead soon is the most important tool I've ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life. Because almost everything, all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure—these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important. Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart.

                About a year ago, I was diagnosed with cancer. I had a scan at 7:30 in the morning, and it clearly showed a tumor on my pancreas. I didn't even know what a pancreas was. The doctors told me this was almost certainly a type of cancer that is incurable, and that I should expect to live no longer than three to six months. My doctor advised me to go home and get my affairs in order, which is doctors' code for "Prepare to die."

It means to make sure everything is buttoned up so that it will be as easy as possible for your family. It means to say your goodbyes. I lived with that diagnosis all day. Later that evening I had a biopsy, where they stuck an endoscope down my throat, through my stomach, and into my intestines, put a needle into my pancreas, and got a few cells from the tumor.

                Having lived through it, I can now say this to you with a bit more certainty than when death was a useful but purely intellectual concept. No one wants to die. Even people who want to go to heaven don't want to die to get there. And yet, death is the destination we all share. No one has ever escaped it. And that is as it should be, because death is very likely the single best invention of life. It's life's change agent. It clears out the old to make way for the new.

Don't let the noise of others' opinions drown out your own inner voice.

                When I was young, there was an amazing publication called <em>The Whole Earth Catalog</em>, which was one of the bibles of my generation. It was created by a fellow named Stewart Brand, not far from here in Menlo Park. And he brought it to life with his poetic touch. This was in the late sixties, before personal computers and desktop publishing, so it was all made with typewriters, scissors, and Polaroid cameras. It was sort of like Google in paperback form, 35 years before Google came along. It was idealistic, overflowing with neat tools and great notions.

It was the mid-1970s, and I was your age. On the back cover of their final issue was a photograph of an early-morning country road—the kind you might find yourself hitchhiking on if you were so adventurous. Beneath it were the words "Stay hungry. Stay foolish." It was their farewell message as they signed off.
